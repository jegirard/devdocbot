## Introduction
This is a sample markdown file that explains a simple calculator function.

## Calculator Function
The `add` function takes two numbers as input and returns their sum. It's a basic
arithmetic operation that can be used as follows:

```javascript
function add(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}
```

## Usage Example
You can use the add function like this:
```javascript
const result = add(5, 3); // Returns 8
```

## Limitations
The function only works with numbers and doesn't handle string inputs or other data types.
